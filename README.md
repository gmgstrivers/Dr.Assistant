We as a team have developed a Full stack website which will assist the doctor and help to predict some 
of the disease which requires a significant amount of time to diagnose it. It also help the patient to connect to the doctor and get solution from their home.
<br>
We have implemented 3 ml models in our site which will be able to predict 
<br>
1.Breast Cancer
<br>
  Repository :- https://github.com/gmgstrivers/MalignantDetector
  <br>
2.Coronary Heart disease 
<br>
  Repository :- https://github.com/gmgstrivers/HeartDiseasePredictor
  <br>
3.Diabetes :- 
<br>
  Repository :- https://github.com/gmgstrivers/DiabetesPredictor
  <br>
These ml models will help the doctor to predict the kind of disease the patient is affected within a significantly less amount of time. The main purpose of our website to provide assistance to Doctors to know about the disease by giving some data from scan reports.
Some of the disease requires a long time to diagnose and some places lack in the machineries and Doctor have to wait for the results. Our objective is to reduce this time and help the doctor to have an idea about the disease before actual report comes up.
This website also benefits the patients as they can directly view their results of the scan from their mobile phone. We are also trying to implement a Relation between Doctor and Patient in our website.
There are still some rural areas where specialised doctor is not available. People belonging to these areas spend a lot of money and time to travel and consult a specialised doctor. We came up with a solution where we will connect this patient with specialised doctors.
In our website Patient will select specialisation of doctor he/she need to consult and can find different specialised doctor of that field. Then the patient can book an appointment. After booking an appointment the patient can put forward it’s queries and can UPLOAD PRESCRIPTION based on which doctor will provide solution and if some serious issues is found, doctor will recommend the patient to physically visit the nearest hospitals.
So in short our site aims to provide a solution to both doctor and patient. 
It will assist the doctor to predict the disease in less amount of time and in the other
side it helps the patient to connect to the specialised doctor, get there queries resolved in a small amount of time and at less travel cost.
