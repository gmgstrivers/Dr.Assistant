We as a team have developed a Full stack site Which will assist the doctor and help to predict some 
Of the disease which requires a significant amount of time to diagnose it. It also help the patient to connect to the doctor and get solution while just sitting in home.
We have implemented 3 ml models in our site which will be able to predict 
1.Breast Cancer

  <br>
2.Coronary Heart disease

  <br>
3.Diabetes :-

This ml models will help the doctor to predict the kind of disease the patient is affected with in a significantly less amount of time. The main purpose of our site to provide assistance to Doctors to know about the disease by giving some data.
Some of the disease requires a long time be to diagnose and some places lack in the machineries and Doctor have to wait for the results. Our objective is to reduce this time and help the doctor to have an idea about the disease before actual report comes up.
This site also benefits the patients as they can directly view their result. We are also trying to implement a Relation between Doctor and Patient in our site.
There are still some rural areas where specialised doctor is not deployed. People belonging to these areas lose a great amount of time to travel and consult a specialised doctor. We came up with a solution where we will connect this patient with specialised doctor.
In our site Patient will select specialisation of doctor he/she need to consult and can find different specialised doctor of that field. Then the patient can book an appointment. After booking an appointment the patient can put forward itâ€™s queries and can UPLOAD PRESCRIPTION based on which doctor will provide solution and if found some serious issues the patient can physically travel to their hospitals.
So in sort our site aim is to provide a solution to both doctor and patient. 
It will assist the doctor to predict the disease in a small amount of time and in the other
Side it helps the patient to connect to the specialised doctor get there queries resolve in a small amount of time and n travel cost.
